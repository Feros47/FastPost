 Algorithm to post TikToks/Reels/Shorts automatically 

 It will upload a userspecified amount of videos to each platform and thereafter move the videos to a different userspecified directory 

So far Reels and Youtube Shorts works, however because of personal information such as passwords and refresh tokens will *InstaUpload.py*, *client_secrets.json* and *credentials.json* not be uploaded publicly

Missing TikTok Api... Will continue with html parsing/scraping
